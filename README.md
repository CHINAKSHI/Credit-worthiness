# Credit-worthiness
Clean Data: The clean_data function handles missing values and outliers in the dataset. It also standardizes city names.

Analyze Data: The analyze_data function generates descriptive statistics and visualizations for the dataset, such as age distribution and gender distribution.

Check Creditworthiness: The check_creditworthiness function calculates the debt-to-income ratio and determines creditworthiness based on a simple criterion (debt-to-income ratio < 0.5). It then summarizes and visualizes the creditworthiness distribution.

Main Function: The main function orchestrates the loading, cleaning, analyzing, and creditworthiness checking processes.
